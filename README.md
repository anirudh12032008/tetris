# TETRIS!!!

I created my Own Tetris game built on a custom PCB, and whats even cooler is that it uses a very tiny mcu, Attiny85 not ESP32, which makes it too compact, there's even a cool case for the PCB.
it uses a 1.3 inch oled display to show the game and 4 buttons for controling. it also has a buzzer to play sounds

you all might have played tetris when you were very small but did you ever created your own tetris!!?? If not then why not!! 

## Why Tetris
Though there are many new mobile and pc games but how can we forget the retro level game that we used to play!!
Tetris is to bring the inner child out and making it on ATtiny85 is definitely worth it

## What it do
You can play the retro game tetris on it
not recommend but you can also play other retro games which have 4 btn controls
