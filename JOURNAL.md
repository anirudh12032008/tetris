# TETRIS
## author: "Anirudh Sahu"
## description: "Tetris game built on a custom PCB, and whats even cooler is that it uses a very tiny mcu, Attiny85 not ESP32, which makes it too compact, there's even a cool case for the PCB. it uses a 1.3 inch oled display to show the game and 4 buttons for controling. it also has a buzzer to play sounds"

## July 20 - 3D Designing
so the worst part came again!!! I hate cad now because I dont have a 3d printer nor I have any of my 3d prints ðŸ˜¢ But yeah I started it and then the usual sketch excrude work and finally it was done I did initally made the wrong holes but then fixed them and yeah cad is too tiring if you dont have good pc specs. SO yeah it takes hell lot of time but somehow I did it
