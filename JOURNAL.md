# TETRIS
## author: "Anirudh Sahu"
## description: "Tetris game built on a custom PCB, and whats even cooler is that it uses a very tiny mcu, Attiny85 not ESP32, which makes it too compact, there's even a cool case for the PCB. it uses a 1.3 inch oled display to show the game and 4 buttons for controling. it also has a buzzer to play sounds"

So first I did brainstortming of what to create and then I thought of the old tetris console and I thought why not create it!!! so I took my pen and copy and made a rough sketch and then I started making the schematic on EasyEDA

Time spent - 2hr

## June 18 - PCB designing

## June 19 - Redesign PCB 
so it was looking ugly so I need to retransform it
so now its vertical looks clean, I added the silkscreen and completed the routing and kindoff finished the full PCB
Time spent - 2hr

## June 20 - 3D Designing
so the worst part came again!!! I hate cad now because I dont have a 3d printer nor I have any of my 3d prints ðŸ˜¢ But yeah I started it and then the usual sketch excrude work and finally it was done I did initally made the wrong holes but then fixed them and yeah cad is too tiring if you dont have good pc specs. SO yeah it takes hell lot of time but somehow I did it

## June 21 - Firmware , BOM
so the most useless works go here, I have never worked with attiny so idk what it will do but got my basic firmware ready and then the most fun part finding the parts and making the BOM. I'm expert in this now so It was too fun actually doing it I loved it
Time Spent - 2Hr
