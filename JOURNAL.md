# TETRIS
## author: "Anirudh Sahu"
## description: "Tetris game built on a custom PCB, and whats even cooler is that it uses a very tiny mcu, Attiny85 not ESP32, which makes it too compact, there's even a cool case for the PCB. it uses a 1.3 inch oled display to show the game and 4 buttons for controling. it also has a buzzer to play sounds"

So first I did brainstortming of what to create and then I thought of the old tetris console and I thought why not create it!!! so I took my pen and copy and made a rough sketch and then I started making the schematic on EasyEDA
