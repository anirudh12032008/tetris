# TETRIS!!!

you all might have played tetris when you were very small but did you ever created your own tetris!!?? If not then why not!! 
I created my Own Tetris game built on a custom PCB and whats even cool is that it uses a very tiny mcu Attiny85 not esp32 which makes it too compact, there's even a cool case for the PCB.
it uses a 1.3 inch oled display to show the game and 4 buttons for controling. it also has a buzzer
